//Changelogs for Firmware Versions------------------------------------
//V1.0.1 added detection for the total number of LEDs a board has. Plugins need a rewrite to make use of this change. Rewritten plugins will not function with older firmware.
//V1.0.2 added another detection byte for which fork of SignalRGB firmware device is running. This means we can keep overlap Unique Identifiers between Sonix and Mainline.
//V1.0.3 unifies the command IDs between Mainline, Sonix, and VIA. All commands have a 0x20 offset now.
//V1.0.4 improves detection handling, and has a complete rewrite of the plugins. Also merges Mainline and VIA branches. VIA Branch is deprecated.
